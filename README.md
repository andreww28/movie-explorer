# Movie-Explorer

THis app is like a File Explorer on Windows, unlike File Explorer, this apps only show all and play movies in your inputted location in path.txt

After you download it, just edit only the elements like label, frame. Change the alignment, width, or height, etc. You should do this because it is possible that tkinter is changing the alignment of the label frame, if we are using different OS or version of windows.


## How to use
Run the app and input your location where your aloo movies located.

If you want to change the location, you can either press the 'change path' button in the app or you can manually change it in path.txt.
